<h2>SnivySquid65/Funkin</h2>

SnivySquid65/Funkin is a fork of FNF where nightly builds are posted for all platforms, guaranteeing you have the new features, no matter your device.

Builds are made on local hardware due to github actions never fulfilling a build.

As such, "Nightly" builds may be released up to 24 hours later than a pull request is merged, due to performance limitations of the devices I own. Please understand, and my apologies for the delays.

Please do not make pull requests for this repository. Changes you purpose for these builds should be made on the official repo if it hasn't been purposed there already!

Pull requests for the official repo are <a href=https://github.com/funkincrew/funkin/pulls>here</a>!
