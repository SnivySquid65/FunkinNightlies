<h2>Quick Disclaimer</h2>
This may be behind schedule, as of writing, it has been 2 months since the last public repository merge for FNF, ironically, this fork was made only a few days after this last commit. I have no idea if they're just working on a new update, on hiatus, working on the full game, whatever. Point is, it might be a while before I start posting nightly builds, as no changes have been made for a while, I'm not checking as much. If new activity happens, I'm turning on emails for PR merges and commits so I can start posting nightly builds as soon as nightly builds start again. They haven't updated anything game related since 0.7.5 dropped, so I'm not in a rush to drop a build. When activity returns though, I'll be prepared (hopefully). Well, until next time,

<h2>SnivySquid65/FunkinNightlies</h2>

SnivySquid65/FunkinNightlies is a fork of FNF where nightly builds are posted for all platforms, guaranteeing you have the new features, no matter your device.

Builds are made on local hardware due to github actions never fulfilling a build.

As such, "Nightly" builds may be released up to 24 hours later than a pull request is merged, due to performance limitations of the devices I own. Please understand, and my apologies for the delays.

Please do not make issues or pull requests for this repository. Changes you purpose for these builds should be made on the official repo (directed at main) if it hasn't been purposed there already!

Pull requests for the official repo are here!
